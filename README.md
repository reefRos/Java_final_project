# Java_final_project
This was my final project in java course.
The code is a data system for a dance club. In it you can add a clubber to the db using his id if he is a civillian, his idf id if the clubber is a solider
and student id if the clubber is a student.
Each time the software closes a binary file which holds the entire db is written, and every time the software boots it reads from that file
and creates a new db.
